**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.13.0**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.10.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.13.0
- Removed compatibility with 1.12.0

## Note about skins
PocketMine-MP **does not support skins made in the Charactor Creator** (known as Persona skins), due to technical changes which would require premature backwards compatibility breaks. The dev team has decided not to support Persona yet.
These skins will be **replaced with a random solid-colour skin. This is not a bug.**
Skins chosen from the Classic tab (classic skins) will continue to work as normal.

# 3.10.1
- Fixed custom plugin-created skins being invisible when no geometry name was specified.
- Updated RakLib to 0.12.6 to fix security bugs.
